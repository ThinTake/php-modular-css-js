# modular-php
**{In development}** It is an PHP class that helps to improve site's performance by includeing only required CSS and javascript for requested page, and reduses http requestes by combining the CSS and JS files

### Note
Right now it is not working with the bootstrap. The bootstrap file needs to be regenerated with some tweaks.

**[BUT]** It is working with ThinTake UI. https://github.com/ThinTake/thintake-ui
